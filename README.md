## Demo App

This is an app built with the MEAN.JS, a full-stack JavaScript open-source solution, which provides a solid starting point forbuilding apps based on [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/).  

The application also uses some key nodes packages for interacting with the [Tent.io] (http://tent.io/)  server:  [tent-auth] (https://www.npmjs.org/package/tent-auth) for authenticating the app with a user's tent server credentials; [tent-discover] (https://www.npmjs.org/package/tent-discover) for discovering tent servers. Discovery is the process of taking an Entity URL and finding the associated meta post in order to locate the servers that represent the entity; [tent-request] (https://www.npmjs.org/package/tent-request) which allows the app to talk to tent servers.
