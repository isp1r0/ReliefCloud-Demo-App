  "readme": "# tent-auth\nA node.js helper for the [Tent](https://tent.io) app authentication process. Thanks to [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) this module can also be used in the browser!\nMore information can be found in the corresponding [docs](https://tent.io/docs/apps).\n\n## install\nWith npm:\n\n    npm install tent-auth\n\n# usage\nWorking examples can be found in the [example](example) folder. To understand how to utilize this module you should really look at these.\nThe [simple one](example/cmdline.js) just goes one time through the auth flow, the [more complex one](example/server.js) spins up a server and remembers entities to support \"logins\" and is extensively commented.\n\n## methods\n\n    var auth = require('tent-auth')\n\n### auth.registerApp(meta, app, function callback(err, tempCreds, appID) {})\nIf the entity didn't authorize the app previously, this is the first function to call. Else this step should be skipped ([server example](example/server.js)).\nIt takes the content part of the meta post (`meta.post.content`), the app post to create (following [this schema](https://tent.io/docs/post-types#app)) and a callback.\nAfter completion, the callback gets passed temporary credentials, which have to be used during the authorization process and the id of the created app post.\n\n### auth.generateURL(meta, appID)\nThis function generates a URL to which the user has to be directed.\nIt requires the same meta object as `auth.registerApp()` and takes the id of the created app post.\nThe return is an object, containing `state` and `url` keys. The state should be persisted, to be able to compare it later.\n\n### auth.tradeCode(meta, tempCreds, code, function callback(err, permaCreds) {})\nWhen the server finally redirects the user to the specified redirect uri, this function can be used to trade the code for permanent tokens.\nUse the `tempCreds` obtained from `auth.registerApp()`.\n\n# test\nTests are currently broken and are in need of a major rework.\n\n# license\nThis software is released under the MIT license:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
